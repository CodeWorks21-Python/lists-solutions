1 - What is a List?

    A list is a mutable ordered sequence of objects.

2 - How can you create an empty list? What about a pre-populated list?

    Empty list can be created via list displays or the list() function.
    list_name = []
    list_name = list()

    A pre-populated list can be made by adding objects within the list displays, or by supplying a sequence to the list
    function.
    list_name = [object0, object1, object2, ...]
    list_name = list(string)


3 - How do you access a list?

    We use the index operators, and supply an index (position).

    list_name[index]

4 - How do you add items to a list? Remove items?

    We can add items to a list using the append() or insert() methods.

    We can remove items by using the remove() or clear() methods.

5 - What happens if you got out of bounds with a list?

    You cause an IndexError.

6 - Why are lists useful to us, as opposed to strings?

    Lists are mutable, meaning we can change the contents of the list whenever we want.


7 - Where a position in a string represents a character, a position in a list represents an ______?

    object

8 - Which of the methods for lists return a value? Which methods for lists operate on the list (change it)?
